## Website Features
Reddit Mini uses the Reddit API servers to grab and displays post and comments to it's users from the most popular post on the site at the given time. Users are also able to navigate subreddits by using the Subreddits tag which will enable them to view different post on the site.
## About The Project
Reddit Mini was created as another milestone project in my journey to learning Front End Web Development. This applications main goal was to take everything I know about React (From Jammin) to organize it and use it within the Redux library. Developing this project came with a bunch of new challenges as I had to get accustomed to a new way of declaring things within programming. Overall it was a wonderful learning experience that caused me a lot of stress but am now happy I can resume most of my training now that the project is complete!
